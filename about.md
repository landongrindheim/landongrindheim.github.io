Landon Grindheim is a bunch of things, but on this blog he mostly exists as
someone that cares about building software. He likes to solve problems and make
things better. His experiences as art student, Peace Corps volunteer and idea
obsessive all inform his craft.

He currently works at [GitHub](https://github.com) as a software engineer. He
lives in North Carolina's Research Triangle with his wife, Jana, and their sons
Kai, Ezra and Wynn. They remember [Nikolai](./nikolai.md).
